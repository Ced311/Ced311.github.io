            Upon opening box number 1 you are instantly teleported in a blinding
            flash of white light. Once your vision recovers from the sudden
            flash, you now find yourself in a dim and eerily lit hallway. The 
            wall are ragged and worn, and as you start to explore, you start to
            realize that the setting is much more maze-like than you'd 
            originally though. You tread this maze for what seems like an
            eternity, seeing various caution signs on the way, Though at this
            point your caution starts to waiver a bit. It waivers up until this
            very moment when you turn yet another corner,finding an oddly shaped
            figure, with beaming read eyes, standing motionless in the middle of
            the hallway. You step back reflexively, eyes glued to this ominous
            statue-like figure, until your eyelids naturally close in a blink.
            In that moment all you can hear is a loud earspliting snap. 
            You never open your eyes again.

            Upon opening box number 2 you are instantly teleported in a blinding
            flash of white light. Your new setting is now a silent and dimly lit 
            corridor. After taking a moment to reorient yourself and get feel
            for the enviornment, you hesitantly start to tread the corridor.
            Upon further inspection the corridor is more futuristic than you'd
            originally though. You come to a doorway at the end of it,
            and attempt to open it. Locked, and suddenly you hear an intense
            hissing noise coming from behind you. You quickly turn to see
            absolutely nothing. Now in fight or flight, your vision darts
            sporadically around the corridor, trying to find the source.
            You then hear the once locked door shift open behind you. You
            turn around, and standing in the doorway before you is a large 
            acid drooling monstrosity. Before you can even leverage you feet to
            run the creature lungs at you at blinding speed. It opens its maw 
            and bites into your frontal lobe, ending you quickly. You are now
            the prey of a xenomorph.
