        <p>
            Your adventure starts from the perspective of a young warrior with a
            fire in their heart for new experiences. You find yourself dwelling
            in a small town by the name of Place. After a time of recuperation
            in this town after your last mission, you decide to set out once
            more to your next awaited objective; that being to make it to the
            large city of Cities just north of here. This cities resources
            are a necessity on your journey. However, the paths to get there are
            very high risk without an air transport. Two branching pathways. one 
            that brings you to the eastern gate of the city via a treaturous
            montain pass, and another that brings you to western gate by way 
            of a dense forest. Which path will you choose?
        </p>
        <p>
            You decide to take the eastern route and head out with viger,
            bidding your recently met aquaintances in the village farwell as you
            leave Place. You set out in the early morning and your trek for the 
            most part is very peaceful, aside from some very minor monsters,
            that even the weakest of warriors could handle. As you continue your
            journey you notice the scenery start to shift significantly. The 
            once rolling foot hills surrounding Place now transition to a much
            more level and heavily vegetated ground. The clear skies now
            obstructed by large overbearing trees. By midday you are
            completely surrounded by forest. You finally come to a break in the 
            tree line and see a small interwoven bridge that follow a river 
            downstream. It will be a clear shot to the city from this point. 
            However it is said to around this season, dangerous aquatic
            monsters become more aggressive along this route, knowing that
            possible prey frequents it. You have two choices. Either follow the
            river, and take the risk in exchange for faster travel, or find
            another route at a distance from the river, but with it still in
            view to not lose your direction.
            
        </p>
            You decide take the western route is best. You head out with
            ambition, having thoroghly prepared yourself for the adventure. You 
            leave early, slightly before sunrise, to have the maximum amount
            of daylight, as you plan to make this a one day journey, arriving to
            the city by dusk. Your path starts out simple enough. As you proceed
            you are attacked by the common place monsters that surrond Place.
            They are nothing you can't handle, and you dispatch them with ease.
            As time progresses the foothill start to raise in altitude with
            every mile until soon you find yourself treking through full on 
            mountain ranges. Now midday the sky has become overcast and you find
            it hard to key visibility on your path due to a combination of 
            heavy cloud cover, high altitude, and the recently added sulphur in
            the air. You've now reached the most dangerous portion of the pass, 
            that your aquaintances back at the village had warned you about.
            This area is filled to the brim with dangerous monsters and 
            volcanic elements that a warrior must be extremely cautious of. You
            have two choices. Either continue down the tedious yet physically 
            clear path with low visibility, or climb to a higher altitude off
            the path to try to get a better feel for your surroundings. 

        <p>
            You decide to continue down the designated path of the river with
            caution. After a while of treading the enviornment, you start to get
            a feel for it. A few aquatic beasts, a step ahead of the monsters 
            back at Place in terms of raw power try to abuse you. With your
            advanced combat skills, you are able to finish them off with not
            much more than a few scratches and scrapes. However, your main
            weapon of choice has blunted severely from striking their thick
            and scaly hides. Finally the path starts to become more managable
            and the foliage starts to disapated. The river levels out. Sunset
            hits, and with about 30 minutes more of travel, You finally see it.
            The large eastern gate, holding the vast city of graces your vision
            , and a tinge of joy and releif populates your visage. Congrats,
            you've finally made it.
        </p>
            You decide to take your chances and remain on the path ahead. You
            place a cloth over your mouth and nose, and put on a conviently 
            bought pair of googles to relieve the effects of the sulphur. You 
            tread with advanced caution. watching your every step as not to
            be overtaken by magma sink holes and abuse predators. Things seem
            to be going fairly well. Until suddenly you hear a gutteral roar
            concealed in smog ahead of you. You quickly take cover. Before you
            can fully conceal yourself a magma geyser erupts near you place 
            of refuge. You bound back athletically managing to avoid the 
            immediate danger , but the impending danger has caught sight of you.
            you turn towards the treat but before you can properly react, in an
            instant you are aggresively pinned to the ground, in the clutches of 
            excessively large claws. You feel a sharp pain piercing your right 
            arm. A puddle of crimson, rolls down your torso, and you feel a 
            upsurge of liquid pooling into your throat. You try to yell in an 
            attempt to relieve the suelturing pain now populating various points
            of your body, but nothing comes out. You look directly at your 
            assalaint, and what you see terrifies you to your core. A large
            reptilian creature with a bloodlust filled glare, a maw of flesh
            rending teeth, and a crown of two distinguised horns. Stands over
            your near corpse-like vessel, skewering your chest and right arm 
            with its large claws. Your last bit of survival instincts kick into 
            high gear, and with your free left arm you attempt you reach for
            your treasured sword hilted at your side. You have just enough range
            for a promising swing towards the creatures neck. You gather every 
            bit of energy let that you can muster, finally let out a battle cry, 
            and quickly send the attack to its intended destination. The monster
            slightly moves its neck and in a flash, The exact opposite of your
            intentions come to fruition. Your treasure sword now cleaved in two.
            The monster opens its maw, letting out an aggrivated roar, then aims
            its razor like teeth directly at your face. The last thing you hear
            is a loud crunch. as your vision is overtaken by the creatures maw.
            Your adventure has ended.
