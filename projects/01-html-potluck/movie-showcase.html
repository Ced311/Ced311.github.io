        Synopsis:
        <p>
            "In a desperate and unjust land, where government corruption rules
            the day, only one man has the courage to challenge the system and
            fight back. They call him "Iron Monkey." Under the shadow of night,
            in the silence before dawn, he fights to give hope to the poor and
            the oppressed. Although no one knows his name and no one knows where
            he comes from, his heroism has made him a living legend to the 
            people and a wanted man to the powers that be."

        Synopsis:
        <p>
            "While racing toward the town of Red Rock in post-Civil War Wyoming,
            bounty hunter John "The Hangman" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his
            fugitive prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) encounter another bounty
            hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and a man who claims to be a sheriff.
            Hoping to find shelter from a blizzard, the group travels to a
            stagecoach stopover located on a mountain pass. Greeted there
            by four strangers, the eight travelers soon learn that they
            may not make it to their destination after all."
